# Lorg Place Unlock Vision

Lorg is evolving into an exploration game driven by outdoor Strava activities (rides, runs, hikes, walks). Athletes unlock real-world places when their routes enter new polygons, lighting up their personal atlas.

## Phase 1 (current)
- Countries, states/provinces, and counties for the US, Canada, and UK.
- Unlocks log the first activity crossing each polygon; UI shows totals and recent additions.

## Near-term goals
- Expand geographic coverage to additional regions (Europe, Asia, etc.).
- Add cities/towns using municipal boundaries or point centroids.
- Layer in parks/outdoor areas (national parks, trail systems, reserves).

## Long-term ideas
- Landmarks & POIs: lakes, mountains, unique attractions sourced from curated datasets or OSM.
- Dynamic “nearby unlocks” suggestions so riders chase new tiles.
- Badges, streaks, and quest lines celebrating exploration milestones.
- Social or shareable snapshots highlighting newly conquered regions.

This roadmap keeps the “visit new places” identity front-and-center as we expand beyond large administrative regions.
