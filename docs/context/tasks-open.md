# Open Tasks & Reminders

- Prompt existing Strava users to re-authorize with `activity:write` scope after deployment.
- Install Lefthook (`npx lefthook install`) locally so hooks run.
- Install git-secrets and register patterns for secrets.
- Monitor Knip reports; remove dependencies if they stay unused (e.g., clean up `zod` already done).
- Future ideas: add Vitest coverage, adopt Storybook, wire Renovate/Dependabot.
